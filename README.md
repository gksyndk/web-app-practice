# ðŸ’» HTML & CSS Practice Repository

Welcome to my frontend playground! This repository contains my ongoing practice with HTML and CSSâ€”experimenting with layouts, styling techniques, responsiveness, and visual polish. Itâ€™s all about getting hands-on with the building blocks of the web.

## âœ¨ What You'll Find Here

- Pure HTML structure experiments
- CSS styling (inline, internal, and external)
- Flexbox and Grid layouts
- Responsive design using media queries
- Simple interactive elements (hover effects, transitions)
- Aesthetic-themed mini projects and mockups
